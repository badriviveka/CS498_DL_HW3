You will implement a multi-label image classifier on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. You will design and train deep convolutional networks to predict a binary present/absent image-level label for each of the 20 PASCAL classes. This will help you gain experience with PyTorch. You will:

Part 1A - Pre-defined Models: Practice and warm up with PyTorch and code. You will be asked to run three experiments (listed below) and report your results and observations. MP3_P1A_Introduction.ipynb will guide you to start.
Train AlexNet (PyTorch built-in) from scratch.
Fine-tune AlexNet (PyTorch built-in), which is pretrained on ImageNet.
Train a simple network (defined in classifier.py from scratch.
Part 1B - Self-designed Models: Design your own model in details to solve this multi-label classification task. MP3_P1B_Develop_Classifier.ipynb will guide you to start.
no pre-trained model is allowed for Part 1B.
you can learn the concepts or ideas from existing models (e.g. VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, etc.)
